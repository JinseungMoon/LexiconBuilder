[ DEFINITION of 'Dial-Up Card Reader' ]
An electronic credit card machine that sends data through an analog phone line and a modem. Dial-up card readers interpret the data in a credit card’s magnetic strip and transmit those credit card details, along with transaction details, to a payment processor. The processor than approves or denies the transaction and sends the relevant transaction code back to the merchant through the dial-up card reader.
[ BREAKING DOWN 'Dial-Up Card Reader' ]
Dial-up card readers are small, inexpensive machines that sit on a countertop and contain a slot for swiping and reading the card’s magnetic stripe as well as a keypad to input data. These readers also have small rolls of thermal paper for printing signature slips and receipts. They can also be used with both credit cards and debit cards.
Some merchants use dial-up card readers to authorize and authenticate credit card transactions instead of point-of-sale terminals that use a dedicated network connection for data transmission. While dial-up card readers use older technology and are slower, they are considered a more secure method for transmitting credit card details than network-based card readers. For this reason, some merchants prefer them because they help them comply with regulations developed by the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council to help protect cardholders from having their credit card details stolen and used fraudulently. Dial-up readers reduce risk by minimizing the merchant’s storage of cardholder information. Merchants who violate PCI standards face steep fines.
Before dial-up card readers, merchants used manual card imprint machines made of plastic and metal, colloquially called “knuckle busters.” These machines used carbon paper to make a copy of the raised numbers and name on a credit card. Merchants then had to manually input the information from the carbon copy slips and transaction receipts to credit card processors.
The newest type of card reader is a mobile card reader. This small device attaches to a cell phone or tablet and lets the merchant swipe the customer’s card and process the payment over a cellular or WiFi connection.
