[ DEFINITION of 'Houseable' ]
A piece of art that is able to fit inside a regular-sized living area. Houseable artwork is generally considered to be more affordable because of its smaller size, though this is not always the case.
[ BREAKING DOWN 'Houseable' ]
When beginning an art collection it is important to note the space that the artwork will be displayed in. An artist may produce works in a variety of scales, from drawings and watercolors to large-scale installations, such as mobiles or multi-panel paintings.
Large scale works displayed in small areas may make it difficult to see the work in its entirety, especially if it will be obscured by furniture. For example, "Luncheon of the Boating Party" by Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919) is 51 inches wide – four and a quarter feet, while Mark Rothko’s (1903-1970) "Orange, Red, Yellow" is nearly eight feet tall.
