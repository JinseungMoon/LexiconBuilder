[ DEFINITION of 'Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act ' ]
A federal law designed to ensure equal pay for all workers, regardless of sex, race, national origin, age or religious affiliation. Signed into law by President Obama, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act reinstated the protection against pay discrimination that had been removed by the Supreme Court in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. in 2007. It restored previous protections  regarding the equal treatment of employees, most notably Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The 2009 statute clarified that any inequitable payments are unlawful, even if they result from a pay decision made in the past.
[ BREAKING DOWN 'Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act ' ]
The Act is named in honor of Lilly Ledbetter, a former manager at a Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. plant in Alabama. After Ledbetter discovered that her male peers were receiving substantially higher pay for similar roles, she filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
When her case eventually went to trial, the jury ruled against the company and awarded Ledbetter approximately $3.3 million in damages. However, an appellate court overturned the decision, arguing that the original decision regarding her pay was made several years earlier and that she filed her grievance too late. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the appeals court decision in 2007.
Despite losing her case, Ledbetter began lobbying Congress to pass stronger legislation that would help women and minorities who found themselves in a similar situation. She eventually succeeded, with President Obama signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law on January 29, 2009.
Those supporting the law assert that wage discrimination is widespread. President Obama himself has cited Census Bureau data suggesting that women make 77 cents for every dollar than a man earns. While some dispute this figure – critics contend, for example, that women tend to work part-time more than men – the existence of a gender pay gap is widely acknowledged.
